### DESCRIPTION - Describe the package in a few paragraphs
#### What is the purpose of this analysis project?

To help mortgage applicants determine their potential to be approved or denied based on several factors such as income, gender, occupancy type, and ethnicity for three popular mortgage application states with the success rate for each state's respective counties. The three states that are included for this project are Texas, Washington, and New York. 

#### What is the model and what value does it bring?

This project showcases the power of a finely tuned logistic regression model alongside intuitive, interactive visualizations to examine the most recent mortgage application data extracted from the HMDA. Through prioritizing interpretability and user-centered design, we built a framework and visualization tool tailored to provide mortgage applicants with precise forecasts tailored to their unique circumstances.
